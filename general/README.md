# General Interview questions


## list addition
### problem
given two lists of digits representing multidigit numbers, in order of decreasing significance, implement decimal integer addition.
#### examples
1. [1,2,3] + [3,2,1] => [4,4,4]
### expectatons
#### cases
the development of test cases that discover edge cases.
eg:
1. carrying over
1. lists of unequal length
#### libraries
1. familiarity with modulo operator
1. ways ways of iterating over two lists
   - for each in join
   - for i in lenth shorter
#### algorithms
- How does the candidate iterate backwards?
- do they use three-value addition?
- how do they pad to equal lengths? If they do.

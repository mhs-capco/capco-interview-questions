# Party Question 1
## Intro
This series of questions has been used to squeeze a technical assessment out of as little as 25 minutes.

## Question Sequence
1. implement a function to detect if a submitted string is a palandrome.
1. "Now that we have our 'cool' string processing IP, discuss we might go about making it available to the world as a web service"
1. Given that we now have an endpoint to our service, what data might our business and engineering leaders want us to capture? What entities do you foresee, what storage tools would you use, and what schema's(data archetypes) would you capture.
1. Now that we have our cool string processing tool, and the ability to capture 'interesting' metadata, how should we deploy? What tools, strategies, techniques to you envision being a part of our developement pipeline and deployment strategy?
1. We now have a successful service, as part of our monitization plan, we need to introduce security. What steps do you foresee as needed inorder to "lock down" our endpoint to valid users?
1. We now have a *wildly* successful service, and need to rate limit requests. How would we go about implementing ratelimitting for our API? (What strategies, tools, ect do you anticipate using as part of this effort?)
